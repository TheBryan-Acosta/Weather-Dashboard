## **Description**

Challenge 06 This Weeks challenge was to create a Weather Dashboard

### **What was developed**

A mobile responsive weather app that displays the current weather, and its five day forecast from a given city.

### **Development** -

For the weather data, I used two server-side apis, one to get the longitude and latitude from a city,
and another to use those values to get the weather information, using OpenWeatherMap Onecall & GeoLocation api.
Mobile responsiveness and gid layout were thanks to bootstrap and media queries.
Js libraries used were MomentJs for dates and times, and jquery framework.
